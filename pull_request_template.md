[Explain what this article is about and why it should be included here]

By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements ðŸ––

Requirements for your awesome dev article:

* [ ] **Non-redundant:** The article's message is different from all other articles in the list. If the article is of
    higher quality than an existing entry, then a justification may be made to replace the existing one.
* [ ] **Wide appeal:** The article is useful to programmers at large, not only to practitioners of a particular
    programming language or sub-domain. There is a "Special Topics" section for niche topics, but they must still be
    accessible to a general programmer audience.
* [ ] **Timeless content:** As much as is possible in this fast-paced industry, articles must have long-term relevance.
    Ask yourself: will someone still want to read this article five years from now?
* [ ] **Author variety:** This list should not contain too many articles from any single author. If the list already
    has five or so articles from the same author, consider whether it's better to find someone else's take on the
    subject.

Requirements for your pull request:

* [ ] **Correct Formatting:** Each item has the following format: `{hyperlinked_article_title}[ ({additional_context})] - {author(s)}`
    * `{hyperlinked_article_title}` is the link, using the *exact* title as it appears in the article.
    * `[ ({additional_context})]` adds factual context to the title in situations where the article title alone does
        not sufficiently describe the topic. In particular, it's not for justifying why an article is worth reading.
* [ ] **Categorized:** Place the article in the most appropriate category, or create a new one. Categories should be
    specific enough to have at most a few dozen entries, and broad enough to be able to contain multiple
    language-specific topics,
* [ ] **Updated Table of Contents:** If changing categories, the Table of Contents is updated accordingly.
